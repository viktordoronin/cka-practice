# CKA Lab Practice
These are my solutions for the exercises from [David Holder's CKA study guide](https://david-vtuk.github.io/CKA-StudyGuide/). I don't actually intend to take CKA anytime soon, I only did this to practice Kubernetes. I used a mix of imperative(`.sh`) and declarative(YAML) declarations depending on what made sense for a specific exercise. I used `minikube` as my cluster.
